# Music Genre Classification

A deep learning project that uses audio files to automatically categorise various musical genres. 
These audio files will be categorised based on their low-level frequency and time domain characteristics.

# Theory
Have used K-nearest neighbors algorithm because in various researches it has shown the best results for this problem.
Popular machine learning algorithms for regression and classification include K-Nearest Neighbors. 
Based on the distance between the data points and other similarity metrics, it makes predictions about the data points.

# Summary 
In this music genre classification project, I have developed a classifier on audio files to predict its genre. I have worked through this project on GTZAN music genre classification dataset. This tutorial explains how to extract important features from audio files. In this deep learning project we have implemented a K nearest neighbor using a count of K as 5.

# Results
Obtained accuracy of 69%
